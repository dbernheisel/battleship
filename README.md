# Battleship

## Description

The classic game of Battleship! Written in pure ruby.

## Usage
- Clone this repository `git clone https://github.com/dbernheisel/battleship.git`
- Change into the directory `cd battleship`
- Run Battleship `ruby battleship.rb`
- The game will start to prompt you.

If you want Normal mode's test to work, you will need to go back to a previous commit.
- Clone the repository
- go into the directory
- run `git checkout 84d85df`
- Now you can run `ruby battleship_test.rb` and you'll get a fabulous test.

## Features

- Salvo Mode!
- Wicked ASCII art.
- Dumb AI so you can win easily.
- Setup a board with any grid size (up to 702, but _really_?).
- Have any number of ships of any length.
- Includes tests that don't work anymore! If you want the tests to work, then clone the repository on an older commit without some of the features above.

## TODO
- [x] Add salvo mode
- [x] Pass all the tests
- [ ] Re-write tests to anticipate new "onboarding" user flow.
- [ ] Write 10 more tests
